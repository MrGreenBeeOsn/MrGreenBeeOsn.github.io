This means revenue is recorded the moment it is earned (when the service is done or product is handed over), even if the customer hasn't paid you yet."},{id:2,question:"Which of the following is a characteristic of cash basis accounting?",options:["It follows the matching principle.","It records accounts receivable and accounts payable.","It is generally simpler to maintain than accrual accounting.","It is required by IFRS and GAAP for large public companies."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Cash basis is straightforward because it only tracks actual money coming in and going out. It doesn't require complex tracking of what people owe you or what you owe others."},{id:3,question:"If a company pays $12,000 for a one-year insurance policy in advance, how is this recorded under cash basis accounting?",options:["As an asset (Prepaid Insurance).","It is not recorded until the insurance period ends.","As a full $12,000 expense the moment the cash is paid.","Spread out as a $1,000 expense each month."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"In cash accounting, expenses are recognized immediately when paid. The entire amount is deducted from your balance the moment you pay the bill, regardless of how long the insurance lasts."},{id:4,question:'The "Matching Principle" in accounting is a core concept of:',options:["Cash basis accounting.","Accrual basis accounting.","Tax basis accounting.","Both cash and accrual accounting."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The Matching Principle states that expenses should be reported in the same period as the revenues they helped earn. This is the fundamental logic that makes accrual accounting different from cash basis."},{id:5,question:"A company performs a service in December 2025 but receives payment in January 2026. Under accrual accounting, the revenue is recognized in:",options:["December 2025.","January 2026.","Both years (50% each).","Neither year."],correctAnswer:0,explanation:'Since the service was performed in December, the "earning" event happened in 2025.

This helps investors see how much the company is actually earning, not just how much cash is in the bank."},{id:7,question:"Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable are typically found on the balance sheet of a company using:",options:["Cash basis accounting only.","Accrual basis accounting only.","Both cash and accrual accounting.","Neither; these are income statement accounts."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:`These accounts track money "to be paid" or "to be received" in the future. Since cash basis only cares about current cash, it doesn't need these placeholders.`},{id:8,question:"Why might a small business prefer cash basis accounting?",options:["It tracks long-term liabilities better.","It provides a better match of expenses against revenues.",'It is easier to track the actual "cash on hand."',"It is required for all businesses by law."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Small business owners often need to know exactly how much spendable cash they have right now. Cash basis reflects the bank balance more closely than accrual accounting."},{id:9,question:'In accrual accounting, an "Accrued Expense" refers to:',options:["An expense that has been paid but not yet incurred.","An expense that has been incurred but not yet paid.","Revenue that has been earned and received.","A cash purchase of equipment."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:`An accrued expense is a cost you have already "used up" (like electricity used during the month) but for which you haven't received or paid the bill yet.`},{id:10,question:"If a company has high sales on credit but hasn't collected the cash yet, how will its Net Income look?",options:["Higher under cash basis than accrual basis.","Higher under accrual basis than cash basis.","The same under both methods.","Zero under both methods."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Accrual accounting counts those credit sales as revenue immediately, which increases Net Income. Cash basis ignores them until the cash actually arrives, leading to a lower reported profit."}];return e.jsx("main",{className:"image image2",children:e.jsxs("article",{children:[e.jsx("h4",{children:e.jsx(t,{smooth:!0,to:"/accounting#accounting-basic-practice",children:e.jsx("mark",{className:"highlight-tertiary-padding-4-8",children:"Quiz"})})}),e.jsxs("header",{className:"quiz-header",children:[e.jsx("h1",{className:"margin-y-50 text-center",children:"Cash vs. Accrual Accounting"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"subtitle text-center",children:"Test your knowledge of fundamental accounting concepts"})]}),e.jsx(n,{questions:a}),e.jsx("div",{className:"viewcounter",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"post-date no-margin",children:e.jsx("span",{children:"February 12, 2026 · by 💎Gem ·"})})})]})})}export{o as default};
