The auditor controls this risk by adjusting the nature, timing, and extent of their substantive procedures."},{id:3,question:"An auditor issues an Adverse Opinion on a client's financial statements because:",options:["The auditor could not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.","The financial statements contain a material misstatement that is not pervasive.","The financial statements are materially misstated and the effects are considered pervasive.","The client management refuses to sign the management representation letter."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"An Adverse Opinion is issued when the financial statements are so materially misstated and the effects are deemed pervasive to the financial statements as a whole that they do not present fairly the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows."},{id:4,question:"Which type of audit evidence is generally considered the most reliable?",options:["Evidence obtained from internal documents of the client that have been circulated widely.","Evidence obtained directly by the auditor from independent external sources (e.g., bank confirmations).","Oral representations made by senior management.","Scanned copies of documents held by the client, without original verification."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Evidence is generally more reliable when it is obtained from independent sources outside the entity and when it is obtained directly by the auditor (e.g., confirmation or direct observation)."},{id:5,question:"The concept of materiality in an audit is:",options:["Determined solely by a fixed percentage of revenue or total assets.","An absolute dollar amount set by the applicable accounting standards for all companies.","Based on the auditor's professional judgment and a consideration of the surrounding circumstances, including both quantitative and qualitative factors.","A concept relevant only to financial statement elements with a high risk of fraud."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Materiality is a matter of professional judgment.
