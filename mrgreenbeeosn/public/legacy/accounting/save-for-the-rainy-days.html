    <h2 class="margin-bottom-50 text-center">☘️ Think simply!</h2>

    <p>Imagine you're a squirrel gathering nuts for the winter!  You love running around outside in the sunshine, playing with your friends, and finding yummy acorns and berries. But winter is coming, and the weather will get cold and snowy. That means there won't be as many yummy things to find outside.</p>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Here's why squirrels save nuts for rainy days (winter):</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Sunshine Snacks</strong> (<strong>Spending Now</strong>):  You find a delicious acorn and gobble it right up!  There are lots of yummy things to eat in the sunshine, so you might not feel like saving everything you find.  Eating your snacks now is like enjoying the sunshine and all the fun things summer brings.</li>

        <li><strong>Winter Munchies</strong> (<strong>Saving for Later</strong>):  But you also know that winter is coming. So, you might hide some of your acorns in secret spots around the park.  Saving some nuts for later is like putting some of your favorite snacks away in a special box at home. That way, when winter comes and there's no more food outside, you'll have a stash of yummy things to munch on!</li>

      </ul>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Why save snacks for winter?</h4>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Be Prepared for Winter</strong> (<strong>Unexpected Needs</strong>):  Having a stash of saved acorns means you won't be hungry in the winter. It's like having a cozy blanket at home to keep you warm even on the coldest days!</li>

        <li><strong>Not Everything is Sunshine</strong> (<strong>Tough Times Happen</strong>):  Maybe you get a tummy ache and can't eat all the berries you find.  Having some saved acorns means you still have a snack to enjoy. It's like having a spare toy in your backpack in case you lose your favorite one!</li>

      </ul>
    
    <p class="margin-top-20"><strong>Little Saves Make Big Stashes</strong> (<strong>The Power of Saving</strong>):  Even if you can only hide one acorn each day, it adds up over time! The more acorns you save, the more snacks you'll have for winter. It's like collecting pebbles every day – soon you'll have a whole pile strong enough to build a little wall around your hiding spot (savings) to keep your acorns safe.</p>

    <p>Saving for rainy days is a grown-up squirrel skill that helps you feel secure. It's about putting away some things you like today, even when times are good, so you have something to enjoy when things get tough. This way, you can keep playing and having fun all year round, even in the winter!</p>
