    <p><strong>Law</strong> is like the rules of a big playground.</p>

    <p>Imagine the whole world is a giant playground. There are lots of kids playing, and everyone needs to know how to play nicely together. <strong>Law</strong> is like the rules that tell us what we can and can't do on this big playground.</p>

    <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">For example</h4>

    <p>One rule might be: "Don't hit other kids." That's a <strong>law</strong>! Or, "Share your toys." That's a <strong>law</strong> too.</p>

    <p>Grown-ups make these rules to keep everyone safe and happy.</p>

    <p className="margin-top-20">So, <strong>law</strong> helps us all play together without fighting or being mean.</p>
