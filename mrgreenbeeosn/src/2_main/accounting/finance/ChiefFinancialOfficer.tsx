			<p>Imagine your family has a giant piggy bank where you save all your money for fun stuff! A <strong>Chief Financial Officer</strong> (<strong>CFO</strong>) is like the super-smart grown-up in charge of your family's piggy bank. Here's what they do:</p>
			
				<ul className="list-square">
			
					<li><strong>Money Master</strong>: The <strong>CFO</strong> is like a super-detective who knows exactly how much money is in the piggy bank. They count all the coins and make sure none are lost or missing.</li>
			
					<li><strong>The Planner</strong>: The <strong>CFO</strong> is like a super-smart planner who decides how to use the money. Should you save up for a big toy? Or buy lots of smaller toys and candy instead? They help everyone decide.</li>
			
					<li><strong>Super Safeguard</strong>: The <strong>CFO</strong> makes sure the piggy bank is safe, and the money is used wisely. They remind everyone not to break the piggy bank and spend money when you haven't saved enough.</li>

					<li><strong>Telling stories with money</strong>: When it's time to break the piggy bank, the <strong>CFO</strong> makes sure you know how much you saved and how much each thing you want to buy will cost. They're like storytellers who use money to tell you if you can buy the things you want.</li>
			
				</ul>

			<h3 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Why is a CFO important?</h3>
					
				<ul className="list-square">
			
					<li><strong>Smart decisions</strong>: Just like grown-ups need to be smart about spending money, companies need a <strong>CFO</strong> to help them make good choices about their money.</li>
			
					<li><strong>No wasted money</strong>: The <strong>CFO</strong> helps make sure every coin in the piggy bank is used well and your family makes smart decisions about buying fun stuff! Companies need to do the same with their money.</li>
			
					<li><strong>Big goals</strong>: Imagine wanting a giant trampoline! The <strong>CFO</strong> would help figure out how much to save each week and when you'll have enough to buy it. Companies set big goals too, and the <strong>CFO</strong> helps them plan how to reach them with money.</li>
			
				</ul>

			<p className="margin-top-20">Things to remember about <strong>CFOs</strong>:</p>
			
				<ul className="list-square">
			
					<li><strong>Important job</strong>: They have a super important job making sure the piggy bank is safe and helping everyone make smart decisions with the money.</li>
			
					<li><strong>Grown-up work</strong>: It's mostly a job for grown-ups, but it's good to understand what they do, just like knowing that grown-ups need to budget for things you need (food, house, toys!).</li>
			
					<li><strong>Money superheroes</strong>: A <strong>CFO</strong> is like a superhero who protects the piggy bank and helps your family (or a company) use money wisely to achieve their goals!</li>
