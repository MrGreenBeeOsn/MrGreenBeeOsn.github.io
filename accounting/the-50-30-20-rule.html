    <h2 class="margin-y-50 text-center">What is the 50/30/20 Rule?</h2>

    <!-- This is the content of Financial Term. -->

    <p><strong>The 50/30/20 rule</strong> is a simple budgeting method that divides your after-tax income into three categories:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>50% for needs</strong>: These are essential expenses like rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, and minimum debt payments.</li>

        <li><strong>30% for wants</strong>: This covers discretionary spending, such as dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and shopping.</li>

        <li><strong>20% for savings and debt repayment</strong>: This portion is crucial for building an emergency fund, paying off debt, and saving for long-term goals like retirement or a down payment on a house.</li>

      </ul>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Example:</h4>
     
    <p>If you earn $3,000 after taxes, you would allocate:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li>$1,500 for needs</li>

        <li>$900 for wants</li>

        <li>$600 for savings and debt repayment</li>

      </ul>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Remember:</h4>

    <p>This is just a guideline. You can adjust the percentages based on your financial situation and goals. The key is to find a balance that works for you.</p>

    <h3 class="margin-bottom-50 text-center">☘️ Think simply!</h3>

    <p>Imagine you have a big bag of stickers.</p>

    <p>You can use <strong>the 50/30/20 rule</strong> to decide how to share your stickers:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-square">

        <li>50 stickers for things you need, like food and your home.</li>

        <li>30 stickers for things you want, like toys or games.</li>

        <li>20 stickers to save for later or buy something really special.</li>

      </ul>

    <p>This helps you make sure you have stickers for everything and don't run out!</p>
