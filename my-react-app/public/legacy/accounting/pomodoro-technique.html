    <h2 class="margin-y-50 text-center">What is Pomodoro Technique?</h2>

    <!-- This is the content of Business Term. -->

    <p>The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a time management method designed to help you focus on tasks and avoid procrastination. It uses a timer and short breaks to keep you motivated and productive. Here's how it works:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Work in Chunks</strong> (<strong>Pomodoros</strong>): The core of the technique is the "pomodoro," a 25-minute work interval. During this time, you focus all your attention on a single task, with minimal distractions like checking your phone or social media.</li>

        <li><strong>Short Breaks to Recharge</strong> (<strong>Short Breaks</strong>): After each pomodoro, you take a short break of 3-5 minutes to refresh your mind and body. Get up, move around, grab a snack, or do some stretches.</li>

        <li><strong>Multiple Rounds</strong> (<strong>Sets</strong>): The technique typically involves working through 4 pomodoros (work intervals) followed by a longer break of 20-30 minutes. This longer break allows you to recharge for the next set of focused work periods.</li>

        <li><strong>The Tomato Timer</strong> (<strong>The Name</strong>): The word "pomodoro" comes from the Italian word for tomato, and the technique was named after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer the inventor used as a student. (You can use any timer these days, though!)</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Here are some of the benefits of using the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Improved Focus</strong>: By breaking down work into manageable chunks and minimizing distractions, you can train your brain to stay focused for longer periods.</li>

        <li><strong>Reduced Procrastination</strong>: The short bursts of work with defined breaks can make tasks seem less daunting and help you overcome procrastination.</li>

        <li><strong>Enhanced Productivity</strong>: By staying focused and avoiding distractions, you can get more done in less time.</li>

        <li><strong>Boosted Motivation</strong>: The short breaks and sense of accomplishment after completing pomodoros can help you stay motivated throughout the day.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Here are some things to consider about the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Finding the Right Time</strong>: Some people might find 25 minutes too short or too long for certain tasks. Experiment and adjust the intervals to fit your needs.</li>

        <li><strong>Sticking to the Breaks</strong>: It can be tempting to skip breaks or work longer stretches, but taking those short breaks is crucial for maintaining focus.</li>

        <li><strong>Managing Distractions</strong>: The technique relies on you minimizing distractions during the work intervals. You might need to silence your phone notifications or find a quiet workspace.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Here are some common uses for the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Studying for exams</strong>: Breaking down study sessions into focused intervals can help retain information more effectively.</li>

        <li><strong>Completing work projects</strong>: The technique can help you stay focused on specific tasks and avoid getting overwhelmed by large projects.</li>

        <li><strong>Writing assignments</strong>: Breaking down writing tasks into smaller pomodoros can help you avoid writer's block and make steady progress.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">In conclusion, the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a simple yet effective time management method that can help you improve focus, reduce procrastination, and boost your overall productivity.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a way to help you tackle your chores or homework without getting bored or overwhelmed. Imagine you have a bunch of toys scattered around your room, and you want to clean them up but it seems like a big job! The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> helps you clean up in small chunks, like this:</p>

      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Toy Time</strong> (<strong>Pomodoro</strong>): Set a timer for 25 minutes, like an hourglass for grown-ups. This is your "toy time" to focus on picking up one kind of toy, like all your cars or blocks. Put them away super fast like a game!</li>

        <li><strong>Short Break</strong> (<strong>Short Break</strong>): When the timer goes off, it's snack and playtime! Take a short break for 3-5 minutes to do something fun, like having a healthy snack or playing with a different toy.</li>

        <li><strong>Clean Up Again</strong> (<strong>Sets</strong>): Do another round of picking up toys for 25 minutes, then take another short break. You can do this cleaning game 4 times in a row, just like playing 4 rounds of your favorite board game.</li>

        <li><strong>Big Break</strong> (<strong>Longer Break</strong>): After 4 rounds of cleaning up toys with short breaks, take a longer break for 20-30 minutes. This is like a big reward for all your hard work! You can read a book, play outside, or do whatever you like.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is like a game that helps you clean up or do your homework in small chunks with fun breaks in between. This way, the big task doesn't seem so scary, and you can finish it feeling happy and accomplished!</p>
